### Project Description:

The aim of the project is to build a forum so Rutgers students could rate the courses they have taken, provide advice to students for planning their course schedule and career path. Rather than searching posts randomly on reddit for advices, or reading unverified reviews about professors people made on ratemyprofessor, we want to provide a one-stop forum where Rutgers students could freely express their opinions about courses, seek academic advices, and make friends.
